I have submitted my PhD thesis titled "Video-based Music Generation". You can find the project details [here]({{ "/projects/soundtrack/" | relative_url }}). My most recent [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10154) summarizes the overall methodology and is currently under review in IJCAI 2025.

I am currently awaiting a thesis defense date and looking for postdoc opportunities in deep learning and multimedia.
