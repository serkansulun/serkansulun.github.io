I presented my paper in IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia 2024, in Tokyo. This paper is the result of my online web application for video emotion classification, hosted on Google Colab. You can access it using the following links:

I also make the extracted pretrained features for the Ekman6 and VideoEmotion8 datasets on Zenodo. I additionally include a ekman6_blacklist.txt file, listing the videos which I found are wrongly labeled.
