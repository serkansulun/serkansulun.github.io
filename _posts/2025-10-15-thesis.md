I have successfully defended my PhD thesis titled "Video-based Music Generation". You can find the project details [here]({{ "/projects/soundtrack/" | relative_url }}). My most recent [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10154) summarizes the overall methodology and is accepted to be published in IEEE Transactions on Multimedia.

I also explain video-based music generation in my most recent talk.
