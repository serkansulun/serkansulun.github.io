I had the honor of receiving an award for presentation of my [PhD research]({{ "/projects/emotion/" | relative_url }}) at the 2023 EPIA Conference on Artificial Intelligence, in the beautiful Azores Islands in Portugal.

I additionally presented our paper "Emotion4MIDI: a Lyrics-based Emotion-Labeled Symbolic Music Dataset". The paper is available on [Springer Link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-49011-8_7) and on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14783). The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/serkansulun/lyricsemotions). Presentation:

I also would like to thank the organizers of EPIA 2023 for the prize money, which I've already spent on swimming with the sharks in Azores:
