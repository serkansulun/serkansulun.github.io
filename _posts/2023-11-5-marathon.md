I have completed the 42 km Porto Marathon in 4:20:05 (in case you are wondering, it is pretty average). I was given a medal alongside the "worst-dressed runner award."

To prepare for the marathon, I followed [Hal Higdon's Novice 1 Plan](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-1-marathon/). I liked this program for its simplicity â€” unlike Nike's program, there was no need to adjust pacing or follow intervals. I simply ran the target distance without additional concerns. I must admit, I rested on cross-training days, which resulted in a weekly routine of two short runs, one medium run, and one long run. I occasionally shuffled the schedule but never skipped a run.

I didn't do much research and simply followed the plan. Apparently, the other requirement is to eat every 30-45 minutes after the first 45-60 minutes. Energy gels are very convenient. If they cause acid reflux, surprisingly, chewing gum helps. If not, antiacid tablets also work.

To battle the boredom during training, I listened to [this Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1D89sbAyVop0Hud1iqE1Gc?si=74b286623d314638). The playlist is upbeat, perfect for running, and features deep cuts that helped me discover new music without getting bored. At 152 hours long, it was more than sufficient for the entire training program.

I'd finally like to thank my friends for the support and the giant beer afterwards.
